<p>Now that I&rsquo;m confident I&rsquo;m getting data into Unreal in a consistent and performant way, I&rsquo;m adding some simple geometry sketches to get started on user interaction.</p>
<p>The dimensions I&rsquo;m pulling out of Rack are in pixels, so I spent a fair amount of time working out how to reverse Rack&rsquo;s calculations and get back to the millimeters the original SVGs are <a href="https://vcvrack.com/manual/Panel#Setup" target="_blank">required to be in</a> (and multiplying by ten since Unreal&rsquo;s unit is the centimeter), as well as adapting Rack&rsquo;s top-left origin to Unreal&rsquo;s center-out style. Now I know that the dimensions Unreal receives can be used as-is for two dimensions. I only have to add the third.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t know the size or shape of each module&rsquo;s body ahead of time, but they only need to be boxes I can paint an SVG on. Because I&rsquo;ve converted the dimensions I&rsquo;m sending to centimeters, which is Unreal&rsquo;s base unit, what I can do is create a 1cm cube &ldquo;unit module,&rdquo; and scale it by the dimensions I&rsquo;ve sent over to Unreal. I do the same with the other meshes and make them all 1cm on the two axes that matter.</p>

<p class="caption">If I&rsquo;m smart about where I set each mesh&rsquo;s origins, they&rsquo;ll naturally sit on top of one another.</p>
<p>All that&rsquo;s left, then, is to put it all together. I&rsquo;ve already been sending over additional data for the params, like min/default/max value, and min/max angle for the knobs, so I go ahead and rotate the knobs based on their values as well. Cables remain simple debug lines for now, but it&rsquo;s looking pretty decent!</p>
