preview_text: Time for a proper demo of the current state of the project. We have a library, context menus, super wiggly cables, and all other stuff we&rsquo;ve seen up to this point. Here it is, all coming together. I have a hard time believing this is all <em>my</em> work. I am beside myself, and so proud of what I&rsquo;ve managed to accomplish in the last year.

<p>Time for a proper demo of the current state of the project. We have a library, context menus, super wiggly cables, and all other stuff we&rsquo;ve seen up to this point.

<p>So then, what&rsquo;s left? A lot! But here&rsquo;s a short list off the top of my head:</p>
<ul>
  <li>User preferences.</li>
  <li>Keeping track of the position of modules between runs.</li>
  <li>Spawning modules in a consistent location (ie, next to the library actor when spawned from the library).
  <li>Launching my build of Rack along with the Unreal app.</li>
  <li>File opening, saving.</li>
  <li>Injecting my module into any opened files, then removing it before I save and close them.</li>
  <li>Packaging all of this up into some kind of distributable.</li>
  <li>And on and on&hellip; a thousand tiny and not-so-tiny things to take care of.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to start focusing on finding a new job, so development here is going to slow down considerably, but I&rsquo;m excited to get this to a place where I can get it into other people&rsquo;s hands.</p>
